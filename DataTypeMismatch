#this line of code has an error that will produce the following error
#TypeError: must be str, not int
print("5 * 3 = " + (5*3)) 
 
# Resolution: 
# print("5 * 3 = " + str(5*3))
#
# To avoid a type error between the string and the integer within the
# print() function, you can make an explicit data type conversion by
# using the str() function to convert the integer to a string.
