#assign values to the total variable and files variable

#the total and files variables are both int/egers

#the value of the total variable is considered an expression; a combination of numbers, symbols, or other values that produce a result when evaluated

total = 2048 + 4357 + 97658 + 125 + 8
files = 5

average = total / files

#use an explicit conversion to convert the answer, an integer to a string so it can be combined with the other string we are printing.
print("The average size is: " + str(average))
