#The equals = operator assigns the value on the right side of the equals = to the object (e.g., a variable) on the left side of the equals = operator. 



# The = equals assignment operator is used to assign a value to a 
# variable.

my_variable = 3*5           # Assigns a value to my_variable      
print(my_variable)          # Printing the variable returns the 
15                          # value assigned to the variable.


                              
# The == equality comparison operator checks if the values of the two
# expressions on either side of the == operator are equivalent to one 
# another.
      
print(my_variable == 3*5)   # Printing the variable returns a Boolean 
True                        # True or False result.
