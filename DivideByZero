#this code will produce the error message:
#ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

numerator = 7
denominator = 0   # Possible resolution: Change the denominator value 
result = numerator / denominator
print(result)
 
# One possible assumption for a number divided by zero error might
# include the issue of a null value as a denominator (could happen when
# using a loop to iterate over values in a database). In such cases, the
# desired outcome may be to leave the numerator value intact. The
# numerator value can be preserved by reassigning the denominator with 
# the integer value of 1. The result would then equal the numerator.
