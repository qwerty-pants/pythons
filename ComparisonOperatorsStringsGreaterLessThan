# The greater than > operator checks if the left string has a higher 
# Unicode value than the right string. If true, the Python interpreter
# returns a True result. Since W has a Unicode value of 87, and you can 
# easily calculate that F has a Unicode value of 70, this comparison is
# the same as 87 > 70. As this is true, Python will return a True 
# result.
print("Check comments to find out how this works.")

print("Checking if Wednesday is greater than Friday.....")

# The less than < operator checks if the left string has a lower 
# Unicode value than the right string. If you reference the Unicode 
# chart above, you can see that all lowercase letters have higher 
# Unicode values than uppercase letters. We can see that B has a 
# Unicode value of 66 and b has a Unicode value of 98. This 
# comparison is the same as 66 < 98, which is true. So, Python will 
# return a True result.
print("Checking if Brown is less than brown.....")
print("Brown" < "brown")
print()


# If the strings have the same first few letters, the comparison will 
# cycle through each letter of each string, from left to right until it 
# finds two letters that have different Unicode values. In this example, 
# both strings share the initial substring "sun", but then have 
# different letters with different Unicode values in the fourth place 
# in each string. So, the fourth letters 'b' and 't' of the two
# strings are used for the comparison. Since 'b' does not have a higher
# Unicode value than 't', the comparison returns a False result.
print("Checking if sunbathe is greater than suntan.....")
print("sunbathe" > "suntan")
print("")


# If two identical strings are compared using the less than < comparison
# operator, this will produce a False result because they are equal.
print("Checking if Lima is greater than Lima.....")
print("Lima" < "Lima")


# This last example illustrates the result of trying to compare two
# items of different data types using the less than < operator. The 
# greater than > and less than operators < cannot be used to compare
# two different data types. 
# print("Five" < 6)
print("< and > cannot be used to compare two different data types.")
