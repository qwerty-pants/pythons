# The == operator can check if two strings are equal to each other. 
# If they are equal, the Python interpreter returns a True result.

# In this example, the variable event_city has been assigned the string 
# value "Shanghai". This variable is compared to a static string, 
# "Shanghai", using the != operator. As, the strings "Shanghai" and 
# "Shanghai" are the same, the comparison of "Shanghai" != "Shanghai" 
# is false. Accordingly, Python will return a False result.

# This last example illustrates the result of trying to compare two
# items of different data types using the equality == operator. The
# two items are not equal, so the comparison returns False.
