#Comparing Things
#Everytime you compare things in Python, the result is a Boolean, True or False
print(10>1)
#10 is greater than 1, so the value true is printed onto the screen

print("cat" == "dog")
#this is the equality operator that determines if the string cat is equal to the string dog
#the string cat is not equal to the string dog in this example

print(1 != 2)
#this is the not equals operator, the negated form of the equality operator
#checks if 1 is not equal to 2

#logical operators and, or, not

#AND - to return true the and operator would need both expressions to be true at the same time

print("Yellow" > "Cyan" and "Brown" > "Magenta")
#alphabetical order is used when comparing strings
#the first statement is true, and the second one isn't so since the first and second expressions are not the same this is false.

#OR - the expression will be true if either expression is true or false when both expressions are false

print(25 > 50 or 1 !=2)
#25 is not bigger than 50 (false) but 1 is different than 2 (true)

#NOT - the not operator inverts the value of the expression that's in front of it.

print(not 42 == "Answer")
