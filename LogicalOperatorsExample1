# Example 1
#The following model demonstrates the use of the and 
#logical operator to join comparisons between two 
#mathematical expressions.

print((6*3 >= 18) and (9+9 <= 36/2))
# Python processes this expression using the order of operations
# (18 isgreaterthanorequalto 18)and(18 is less than or equal to 18)

# this expression becomes True and True
# 
# Python checks if both sides of the expression are true
# 
# since both sides of the statement being evaluated are true 
# the whole statement returns True
