#two friends are eating dinner at a restaurant. The bill comes in the amount of 47.28 dollars. The friends decide to split the bill evenly between them, after adding 15% #tip for the service. Calculate the tip, the total amount to pay, and each friend's share, then output a message saying "Each person needs to pay: " followed by the #resulting number.

# Assign "bill" variable with bill amount, 47.28
bill = 47.28 

# Multiply by stated tip rate, 15%
tip = bill * .15 

# Sum the "total" of the "bill" and "tip"
total = bill + tip 

# Divide "total" by number of friends dining
share = total / 2 

# Enter the required string and "share" 
print("Each person needs to pay: " + str(share)) 

# Hint: Remember to convert incompatible data types

#Each person needs to pay: 27.186
