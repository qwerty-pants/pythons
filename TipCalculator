#two friends are eating dinner at a restaurant. The bill comes in the amount of 47.28 dollars. The friends decide to split the bill evenly between them, after adding 15% #tip for the service. Calculate the tip, the total amount to pay, and each friend's share, then output a message saying "Each person needs to pay: " followed by the #resulting number.

bill = 47.28 # Assign "bill" variable with bill amount, 47.28

tip = bill * .15 # Multiply by stated tip rate, 15%

total = bill + tip # Sum the "total" of the "bill" and "tip"

share = total / 2 # Divide "total" by number of friends dining

print("Each person needs to pay: " + str(share)) # Enter the required string and "share" 

# Hint: Remember to convert incompatible data types

#Each person needs to pay: 27.186
