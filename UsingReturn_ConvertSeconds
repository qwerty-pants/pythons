#the purpose of the convert_seconds function is to convert seconds into hours, minutes, seconds

def convert_seconds(seconds):
    # // operator is called floor division
    # floor division takes only the integer value not the float value
    # example: 5 // 2 is 2 instead of 2.5

    #how many hours are in a given amount of seconds
    hours = seconds // 3600

    #how many minutes are left when you subtract the hours
    minutes = (seconds -hours * 3600) // 60

    #how many seconds remain once minutes are subtracted
    remaining_seconds = seconds - hours * 3600 - minutes * 60

    #return the value of the hours, minutes and remaining_seconds variables
    return hours, minutes, remaining_seconds

hours, minutes, seconds = convert_seconds(5000)

#display the values of hours, minutes and seconds on the screen
print(str(hours) + " hours " + str(minutes) + " minutes " + str(seconds) + " seconds ")
